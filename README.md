# Web Scraper
This is a web scraper which I used to match the best fitting jobs given my resume. The jobs are sourced from Indeed and the resume provided was created by myself in September 2024. This project uses the BeautifulSoup web scraper library, the pypdf library for reading pdf files, and a couple sklearn libraries for NLP.
